<h1>The Best Movies based on the whims of ZR</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Transformers 1986</h3>
<p>This is my favourite childhood movie and despite the terrible animations, it is still better than all the modern Michael Bay crap.<br />Starscream deserves to live</p>
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>Just something rather simple and sweet. And there is Rachel McAdams</p>
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>Again, something simple and sweet and wholesome.</p>
